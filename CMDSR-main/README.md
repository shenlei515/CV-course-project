## Introduction
CMDSR is a novel conditional meta-network framework which helps the SR framework learn how to adapt to changes in the degradation distribution of input. The ConditionNet of our framework first learns the degradation prior from a support set, which is composed of a series of degraded image patches from the same task. Then the adaptive BaseNet rapidly shifts its parameters according to the conditional features. A task contrastive loss is also proposed to shorten the inner-task distance and enlarge the crosstask distance between task-level features. Without predefining degradation maps, our blind framework can conduct one single parameter update to yield considerable improvement in SR results. More details can be found in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.03926)
